Obviously, the leakage of information about wallets can be a big gift to our geopolitical opponents, so I decided to discuss with the Federal Tax Service how well this data is protected.\n\nIn the Federal Tax Service, I was assured that information about the steady cryptocurrencies and addresses-identifiers is stored in a separate internal protected system, and access to it is seriously limited even inside the department, and it is almost impossible to get it from the outside. And although cybersecurity experts love to repeat the mantra “everything that can deliver, sooner or later leaks”, the Federal Tax Service claims that the risk of leakage of sensitive information from its internal systems is now reduced to zero.\n\n- Gorelkin	2025-02-07 07:29:25+00:00

310093	🛢🇪🇺🇷🇺 #LNG #Russia #sanctions \nThe EU is unlikely to offer a rejection of Russian LNG as part of the 16th package of sanctions against Moscow. Due to the high dependence on supplies from Russia. Russian LNG remains one of the last large sources of energy dependence of Europe after the transit of gas through Ukraine was discontinued. In addition, sanctions on the part of the EU require unanimity, which will be difficult to achieve against the backdrop of active opposition of Hungary and the preserved dependence of some other countries from gas from the Russian Federation. Last year, the EU imported record volumes of LNG from Russia, the largest importers were France, Spain and Belgium.\n\nInstead of a sharp refusal of LNG from the Russian Federation, the EU will rely on a roadmap, aimed at a phased reduction in the import of Russian fossil fuel. \n\nEuropean politicians refrain from a sharp tightening of fuel restrictions in order to avoid price shocks that have caused damage to the industries of the region’s industry in recent years. But from 2026 - 2027, it is expected that new deliveries from the factories under construction in the USA and Qatar will help reduce the prices of LNG. \n\n- Sources of BBG	2025-01-24 18:28:54+00:00

The Central Bank will return to the operations in the foreign exchange market according to the budget rule after a pause from November 28.\n\nFor the ruble, this is almost neutral news. Regular operations on the budget rule compensate for the excess or lack of foreign exchange earnings from the fluctuations of the oil market, and the adjustment of the net sales gives the ruble relatively small support. But in the conditions of current volatility and the “unwillingness” of the Central Bank to reduce the volatility of the ruble and such a correction looks useful. Until the end of 2024 and in 1kV 2025, the rate will gravitate to levels of 95-100 rubles./$, Experts believe\n—————————–\nNext year, the course will be in the range of 95–110 rubles./$, And its volatility will remain high, Analysts surveyed by the “Vedomosti” awaits	2024-12-27 06:24:47+00:00

Compared to BTC, there is not a single company or property that you would prefer to own in the long term."" - Michael Saylor\n\nSailor put forward the idea for the US government: buy 20-25% of the BTC network, then catalyze the development of this “reserve capital network” (in the understanding of Silor, the BTC becomes a network of world reserve capital and such an asset). Further, Sailor believes that in pursuit of such a valuable asset as BTC, other countries will begin to sell their other assets and begin to buy BTC. At that time, the United States will already have significant control over this network and, accordingly, when other countries join the race (that very) for the purchase of BTC, the United States will become the main beneficiary from such a race, because Capital will flow in the United States again. \n\nFurther, Sailor believes that by making a shift towards BTC, the United States will be able to demonetize gold as an asset class. Accordingly, the gold of the “enemies of the United States” (quote), which is stored in banks will depreciate, and the US assets will grow more and the United States will control the “world reserve capital network”, as well as the “network of world reserve currency”.\n—————————\nPreviously, Sailor said that according to his model, Bitcoin Act of 2024 (BTC strategic reserve bill) from Senator Lammis, if adopted, leads to a reduction in US public debt by $ 16 trillion (previously Trump was asked the possibility of paying off US debt payments and BTC)"	2024-12-08 15:47:28+00:00
